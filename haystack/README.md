haystack log parsing tool

**Goal:** Build a modular command-line tool that parses authentication logs from the systemd journal, normalizes events into a standard format, and detects suspicious patterns (SSH brute force, repeated sudo authentication failures).

- **Limitations:** v1.0 will only address Arch/journald

**This project is currently under construction**

Stay tuned...
