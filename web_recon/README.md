## Goal

A passive python recon tool designed to sift through the under belly of a web page when you're too lazy to look at the "View Source"

## How to use 
- **Step1:** Ensure you have the `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraies installed
- **Step 2:** Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x web_recon.py 
```
- **Step 3:** Run it and provide a target URL 
- **Step 4:** Review the output

## Notes 
- **Dependencies:** This script requires Python 3. 
- **Ethics:** This is a passive tool for recon and info gathering. Use it responsibly.
- **Accuracy:** This script relies on the site's HTML. If the web page is built entirely out of obfuscated JavaScript, expect to be underwhelmed.
