## Goal
For those of us that have a dual or multi boot setup, it can be a PIA to boot out of one OS into another just to move files. This is a nifty little idea I had to save some time and to perform some basic Linux wizardry.

## How to use
- Step 1: Download the script
- Step 2: Make it executable
- ```bash
  chmod +x openportal.sh
  ```
- Step 3: Run it
- Step 4: You're a wizard

## Notes
- Make sure to replace the UUID # before you run it
- It might be neat to make this automatic on boot up so you don't have to run the script at all. But: DO NOT add this to your /fstab --> chaos will ensue...trust me
- What I'd do differently next time
    - Well not add it to the /fstab obviously
